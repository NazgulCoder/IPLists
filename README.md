# IPLists - Daily Updated VPN IP Lists

Welcome to **IPLists**, a comprehensive repository that aggregates and daily updates lists of VPN IP addresses for both IPv4 and IPv6. Inspired by the [X4BNet list](https://github.com/X4BNet/lists_vpn), this project expands on the original concept by incorporating robust IPv6 support, offering a more extensive resource for network administrators, security researchers, and enthusiasts.

## Overview

IPLists is designed to serve as a centralized resource for VPN IP data, updated every day. Unlike the original X4BNet list that focuses solely on IPv4 addresses, IPLists provides:
- **Dual IP Support:** Comprehensive coverage of both IPv4 and IPv6 VPN IPs.
- **Broad Data Collection:** Aggregated from ASN subnets (sourced from RIPE) of well-known VPN providers.
- **Extended Coverage:** In addition to VPNs, the repository includes ASNs of providers known for their permissive stance toward activities such as pentesting, DDoS, bot operations, and port scanning.

## Data Sources & Inspiration

- **ASN Subnets from RIPE:** Our primary data source, ensuring that the lists reflect known VPN provider ranges.
- **Extended Provider Lists:** Beyond traditional VPNs, we include ASNs from providers who are less restrictive about illicit activities.
- **Inspiration from X4BNet:** Building on the foundation of the X4BNet list, we identified a need for a solution that offers IPv6 support alongside IPv4, leading to the creation of IPLists.

## Disclaimer

The IP addresses provided in this repository are aggregated from public sources and ASN subnets from RIPE. **No guarantees** are provided regarding the accuracy, completeness, or fitness for any specific purpose. Users are advised to verify the data independently before use.

## Future Roadmap

- **Datacenters List:** Future updates will include lists of known datacenters to broaden the scope of the repository.
- **Crawlers List:** We plan to add lists of known web crawlers.
- **Community-Driven Improvements:** Contributions and pull requests are always welcome to help improve and expand the repository.

## Contributions

Your input is invaluable! Pull requests, issue reports, and suggestions are all welcome to further refine and expand this project. Join us in building a more robust and comprehensive VPN IP resource.
